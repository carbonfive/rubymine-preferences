# Rubymine Settings

A small set of standardized settings for Rubymine users at Carbon Five.

To use:

Shutdown Rubymine, then rename/remove the following folders first: codestyles, colors, and keymaps.

```
cd ~/Library/Preferences/Rubymine50
git clone git@github.com:carbonfive/rubymine-preferences.git
```

When you start Rubymine, preferences will be available with the "Carbon Five" name/prefix.

These preferences are guarenteed to work with Rubymine Enoki EAP, but should also work for other versions
reasonably well.
